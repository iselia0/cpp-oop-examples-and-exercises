    Exercise-1: Stock Price Tracker

    Write a C++ program that simulates a stock price tracker function. 
    The stock price tracker function should have the following properties:

    1. Create a function named trackStockPrice that takes the stock symbol (a string) and the current stock price (a double) as parameters.
    2. Inside the function, maintain a static local variable that stores the highest stock price observed for a given stock symbol.
    3. Update the highest stock price if the current price is higher.
    4. The function should return the highest stock price observed for the given stock symbol.

double trackStockPrice(string symbol, double currentPrice) {

/*
    Exercise-2: Bank Account Management

    Create a C++ program that models a simplified bank account management system. 
    In this system, you will create a BankAccount class with the following features:

    1. Each BankAccount object should have a unique account number that starts from 1001 and increments by 1 for each new account created.
    2. Each account should have an account balance.
    3. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
    4. Implement a method to display the account details, including the account number and balance.

class BankAccount {

/*
    Exercise-3: One instance Class

    Create a C++ program that implements a  class, 
    which ensures that only one instance(object) of the class can be created.

/*
    Exercise-4: Prime Number Caching

    Objective:
    Write a C++ program that efficiently generates and caches prime numbers up to 100 and allows you to query the cached prime numbers.

    Requirements:
    1. Implement a function that generates prime numbers up to 100(e.g., generatePrimes(int limit)).
    2. Cache the generated prime numbers for quick retrieval.
    4. Create a menu-driven user interface to interact with the caching system.
    5. Generate and cache prime numbers up to a specified limit.
    6. Check if a number is prime using the cached data.
